Traditional human-centred design (HCD) methods focus on centring human needs, designing seamless user experiences, and evaluating utility factors. However, recent HCI research argues that human-centrism limits our understanding of enmeshed and pluralist design situations, and hence calls for approaches that embrace and can expand the HCI methods to include more-than-human things, beings, materials, and ecosystems. Yet, few concrete HCI methods engage with more-than-human perspectives. In this paper, we explore the use of provocations in design as a means to trigger tensions and reflections, particularly through provotypes and provotyping, as a way for designers to engage with more-than-human perspectives. Through two design examples, we demonstrate how designerly provocations can reveal the entangled relationships between humans and more-than-humans. The aim is to inspire the integration of more-than-human perspectives in HCI research, practice, and teaching.",

However, it remains unarticulated how such research narratives are embedded in the design of digital technology for communal energy futures that are situated in everyday life. While sustainable HCI has identified relevant design narratives, little attention has been paid to those of communal energy projects. In this paper, we scope energy community literature at ACM to identify design narratives that tell stories about how energy communities are imagined and why they are relevant. Through a critical discourse analysis, we describe how design narratives currently shape energy community research on sites, participation, and digital technologies.

While sustainable HCI has identified relevant design narratives, little attention has been paid to those of communal energy projects. In this paper, we scope energy community literature at ACM to identify design narratives that tell stories about how energy communities are imagined and why they are relevant. Through a critical discourse analysis, we describe how design narratives currently shape energy community research on sites, participation, and digital technologies.

Against this backdrop, our study investigates the design vision of a cutting-edge home energy management system created as part of an EU project and householders’ expectations of it. Our findings highlight (mis)alignments that emerged from a questionnaire study with 167 households participating in a field trial of the developed technology. We use the insights to discuss the alignment of sustainable visions, HCI, and the design of future energy systems.},\nbooktitle = {Nordic Human-Computer Interaction Conference},\narticleno = {20},\nnumpages = {13},\nkeywords = {human-centred energy, energy flexibility, Sustainability, domestic, local energy systems, HEMS, smart energy technology},\nlocation = {Aarhus, Denmark},\nseries = {NordiCHI '22}\n}\n",

However, aligning household electricity production and electric vehicle charging have received little attention in HCI although both areas have been pursued separately for a number of years. In this paper, we present findings from a qualitative study that explore the potential of aligning electric vehicle charging with times where renewable electricity is being produced in the household. We present an empirical qualitative study of 5 households (19 persons) that own electric vehicles and also produce their own renewable electricity. Our findings, described in five themes, reveal that aligning charging and electricity production can be a challenge and tension exist for aligning consumption such as motivation, roles, mobility patterns, and electricity producing technology. We further discuss our findings and possible directions for future HCI research in the field.",
